    "morphocell will run RL on a GPU and at each iteration compare restored image with one from the previous iteration.\n",
    "morphocell provides FRC-based resolution metric, which requires a few parameters, for example, `axis` along which 2D FRC is calculated in the 3D image, or `frc_bin_delta`, which sets the thickness of the ring for FRC calculation (see other options in `miplib.ui.cli.frc_options` in [5]). It will also rescale images to isotropic voxels according to provided `voxel_sizes` prior to computing FRC.\n",
